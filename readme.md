# Java Exploration

## Description
I spent a couple hours on a Sunday making this project.  It's my first time using Java outside of an existing project.  I read over some docs and skimmed various online tutorials while troubleshooting blockers I ran into.

In the future I would like to set up some basic inputs to create new Person data and connect this to a moderately-styled frontend.  I also plan on looking in to a better way to get a local server up and running - this feels so bulky.

The current endpoints are
```
- /people/Angela
- /people/Awren
- /people/Ivy
- /people/Juniper
```
